#Boris Bikes
This project was given to us during the third week at Makers Academy. The goal of the project was to introduce us to Object Oriented Programming (OOP) and the very basics of Object Oriented Design (OOD). We had to create a simple system to replicate the Boris Bikes in London therefore some mental consideration had to be given for how this systm would be built. Bikes could also break and would then not be available to rent. There also had to be a garage which would fix the broken bikes. This was my second attempt at the task.
